# The birds and the forests...
## What Am I doing??
As part of the UQ IMage processing Course(ELEC4630), we have been tasked with making some small machine learning models. As part of this I began by trying FASTAI's tutorials
## XKCD?
I have been seeing XKCDs since I was in high school, right when machine learning was starting to really take off. One of the images I saw was the good old bird or forest XKCD. This one can be seen here:

## Running the Problem
I ran the training, taking a few minutes to run on my laptop's cpu and got a an accuracy of 99%, pretty good right!! Machine learning is pretty amazing.
